# Handoff (2026-11-12, before a reboot)

Read this first in the next session. It says where everything stands.

## Before/after the reboot

1. `sudo systemctl mask tmp.mount`, then reboot: /tmp becomes a normal directory
   on the root disk instead of a RAM disk (it took up to 15 GB of RAM and
   pushed swap to 7.1/8 GB). After the reboot `findmnt /tmp` should print
   nothing (or the root filesystem). The root NVMe is 89% full (104 GB free):
   keep an eye on it.
2. `~/.bashrc` now sets `CLAUDE_CODE_TMPDIR=/stuff/tmp/claude`, so Claude Code's
   scratchpad and agent downloads go to /stuff (1.1 TB free). A new Claude Code
   session picks it up; the old scratchpad (in /tmp) is gone after the reboot.
   The Chimera cports checkout used for porting was there: re-clone it with
   `git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/chimera-linux/cports <scratchpad>/cports-full`.

## World

Not running. Claude Code killed it (low memory) at 261 packages built this
pass, while on openocd, openrc-settingsd, openshot. All 16 failures of that
pass have fixes committed but untested (list in git log since 88b01af).
`zig-out` is current (Gradle fixes) and `zig build test` passes;
`outdated --bump` was clean. Restart only when the user asks:

    DKBUILD_FAST_WORK=$HOME/.cache/dkbuild-work ./zig-out/bin/dkbuild world -P 3 --no-check --keep-going --color=always > work/world.log 2>&1; echo "world exit=$?" >> work/world.log

## Written today, not built

- htop 3.5.3, btop 1.4.8, bottom 0.15.0 (1f8cc10)
- gnome-online-accounts 3.58.1 + librest 0.10.2; GOA is an optional dependency
  of dkde: add `gnome-online-accounts-devel` to dkde's builddeps with the dkde
  release that uses it (7e648ac)
- chromium 157 (fetched, not built), electron 42 snapshot, typescript-go,
  rustc-dev, rust-wasm, xdg-utils, ast-grep (earlier today)

## Recipes being written by helper agents (status at handoff time below)

Four agents, brief in the old scratchpad (recipe-brief.md; its rules are the
user's standing rules: build libraries not --disable, -static for every
library, offline builds, documented patches/seds, inert servers, check/fetch
only, no commits). Each reports per package; the lead reviews and commits.

| Batch | Packages |
|---|---|
| desktop + mail clients | NeoMutt, aerc, Claws Mail, Evolution (+ evolution-data-server), Betterbird, HomeBank, KMyMoney, Skrooge, FileZilla, Syncthing |
| mail servers | Postfix, Dovecot, Rspamd, OpenSMTPD, Exim, Stalwart, Mox, listmonk, Roundcube, SnappyMail, SOGo |
| PHP/Perl web apps | InvoicePlane, InvoiceShelf, SolidInvoice, Dolibarr, Kimai, Leantime, BookStack, Firefly III, SuiteCRM, Nextcloud server, LedgerSMB, Webmin |
| admin, documents, other | Docker (moby, cli, containerd, runc, buildx, compose), Netdata, Zabbix, Uptime Kuma, AdGuard Home, Pi-hole, Vikunja, Beancount + Fava, Paperless-ngx, Mayan EDMS, Taiga, OpenProject, ERPNext/Frappe, Twenty, Stirling PDF, Joplin, Frappe Books, Maybe Finance |

AGENT RESULTS: (filled in below when they finish)

## Android NDK from source (Claude's own task)

Plan and survey: wip/android-ndk/NOTES.md. Next steps:
1. `src/snapshot-android-ndk.sh` (+ entry in src/fetch.zig snapshot_scripts):
   sparse blob-less shallow clones of the repositories in NOTES.md at
   android-17.0.0_r1 plus platform/ndk at ndk-r30 and build/soong
   (cc/ndkstubgen, cc/symbolfile), widened to the module paths, packed
   reproducibly.
2. A generator (Python, in the recipe's files/) that reads the `ndk_headers` /
   `ndk_library` modules and installs headers, runs ndkstubgen per arch/API
   (21..37), compiles stubs and crt objects.
3. Recipes: android-ndk-sysroot, android-ndk-runtimes (compiler-rt, libunwind,
   libc++ per Android arch from the tree's LLVM), android-ndk (layout,
   wrappers, ndk-build, cmake toolchain, glslc link to shaderc).
4. Phase 2: static bionic (libc.a), simpleperf, lldb-server.
Survey checkouts: work/ndk/aosp.

## Still open (unchanged)

- Questions in docs/requests.md: Kerberos for curl (Heimdal vs MIT), ast-grep keep/drop.
- Brave (wip/brave/NOTES.md), Euro-Office, Proxmox VE after Chromium.
- Unwritten special cases: PDFium, Frida, Anki, OpenKiosk, Bitwarden desktop,
  Issie, RustDesk client (Flutter is glibc-only), KeePass 2 and gbrainy (Mono),
  epson escpr2 (source RPM), MatterControl (Windows-only).
- The old dotnet snapshot (10.0.114 seed) in cache/snapshots can be deleted.
- Nothing pushed.
